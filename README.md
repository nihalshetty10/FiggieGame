# Figgie - Michigan Hackers

This is a modified version of Figge, a card game created by Jane Street.


## How to Play

Custom settings can be enabled in figgie.py.

Run ```python figgie.py``` to play the game.


## Guide

At the game's start, each player's hand will be shown.
Do your best only to view your hand. 

Each player will then pick an action, suit, and price.

At the end of each round, players' actions and completed transactions are displayed.
